# PanHomoptic

A paleontological overview of the molecular literature for the *Pan*/*Homo* split.

~

The following files generate all figures available on the main text:

+ `GENERATE_Figure_1_and_2.R`
+ `GENERATE_Figure_3_and_4.R`
+ `GENERATE_Figure_5__RUN_MetaAnalysis.R`

The figures availabe in our article's supplementary information can be generated by running the following code:

+ `SI_Fig1.R`
+ `SI_Fig2_Fig3_all_subsets_BMA.R`

Moreover, the file `SI_Fig2_Fig3_all_subsets_BMA.R` runs 4 meta-analyses:

1. Without any data filtered
2. Dataset filtered by the 4.4 Ma threshold
3. Dataset filtered by the 6.2 Ma threshold
4. Dataset filtered by the 7.3 Ma threshold

The last analysis in present in the main text, and can be redundantly performed also with `GENERATE_Figure_5__RUN_MetaAnalysis.R`.

Note that instead of following a normal distribution, there is an unexpected gap at 9–9.5 Ma, and studies seem to cluster in excess around important fossil discoveries.](Figures/Figure_1.png)

**S1. Dataset distribution**
Is the database generally biased toward values that are too recent in geological time to be possible? We would expect that the density curves of estimations (Extended Data Fig. S1) would approximate a normal distribution and, that their left tail should start close to the levels of the fossil thresholds (4.4 to 7.3 Ma). Moreover, they should center at some larger value and then mirror to some extent this pattern at the right tail i.e., normality. Instead, we obtained displaced (starting at ~1.3 Ma) and right-skewed density curves, especially for the Min range values. Overall, these statistical artefacts are strong evidence of a bias towards underestimation of time passed since the *Pan*/*Homo* divergence. As expected, the Max estimations are platykurtic—revealing uncertainty—since deriving a maximum bound from the fossil record is more problematic as it must rely on negative evidence.
