### 0: Formula

formula <- bf(ESTIMATION | se(v) ~ 1 + (1|Author))

### 1: Considerations on Priors

# we can use the function get_prior() to tell us which priors need to be specified
# This function also provides suggestions for default priors:

get_prior(formula, data = ma, family = gaussian) # intercept-only model

# Let's use our average for the the Intercept prior (mu)
mean(ma$ESTIMATION) # ~ 8.9 Ma
# Let's use our average of the error metric the the Intercept prior (sd)
mean(ma$v) # ~ 1.1 Ma

# 2: Define priors

priors <- c(prior(normal(8.9, 1.1), class = Intercept), # 8.9 mu; 1.1 sd
            prior(cauchy(0, 0.1), class = sd)) # Half-Cauchy Distribution

# 3: Run Bayesian meta-analysis

mod <- brm(
  formula = formula, 
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = priors,
  data = ma, 
  cores = 4,
  seed = 1 # Reproducible results
)

# Assessing Convergence

as_draws_rvars(mod)

pp_check(mod, ndraws = 20) # predictions from our priors (blue) vs. data (black)

# The plot indicates that our model captures the overall distribution of our
# dependent variable (although there is a lot of uncertainty in model predictions).

# The Estimate(s) obtained for the Intercept is centered on approx. ... and
